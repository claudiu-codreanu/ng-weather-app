# My Angular Weather App

Little app which I wrote in order to learn Angular basics. It follows Chapter 4 (Building a PWA Weather Application using Angular Service Worker) of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260" target="_blank">*Angular Projects 2nd edition*</a>.

<br>

It shows current weather conditions for any city you choose. To obtain weather info, it calls the open weather map api.

Also, it can be deployed as pwa, so it handles offline or spotty connectivity, plus it can detect if a new version is available, and update itself.

<br>

The instructions in the book are clear and easy to follow. However the subject matter itself is quite challenging. Angular is verbose and complex, so the learning curve is steep.

<br>

But it was fun, and I look forward to the remaining 8 chapters!

<!--By the way, I published the project live, using github pages. Please find it <a href="https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/ng-weather-app/" target="_blank">**here**</a>.-->
